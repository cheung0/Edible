## Inspiration
Here's some food for thought. 1 in 4 people in San Francisco are food insecure, with many of them from underrepresented groups. Surprising right? Now let me add a startling fact: 40% of food in the country, including the Bay Area, is never eaten and thrown away! So all this food is being thrown away, while there are people still starving! I hope to help alleviate this food waste problem in the Bay Area with Edible.

## What it does
Edible is a website that allows users to first search for their leftover food and whatever ingredients they have lying around. With this information, it churns out recipe suggestions. Users can then find more information about each recipe's price, ingredients, and how to cook it.

## How I built it
For the backend, I coded in Python with the web framework Flask and Jinja. I used the spoonacular API to generate recipe information based on the ingredients inputted. And for the frontend, I used HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap library. 

## Challenges I ran into
I had trouble with hitting the correct API endpoints and passing in the things that I wanted to in the Python and Flask backend. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I was able to get a fully functional, full stack website working and call the Spoonacular API correctly. 

## What I learned
This was my first hackathon, and I learned a lot, to say the least. From being better at Python through coding up the backend from scratch, to figuring out why my API wasn't working properly, I was able to further my technical skills.

## What's next for Edible
There are some possible avenues of growth that Edible can take in the future. Some of which include: further development for an iOS / android app, refining and fine tuning the website with more features, and advertising to the populace to further gain users.
